<h2>Conclusion</h2>
In the end the program was a rousing success. I had turned the program on while I was eating lunch and low and behold a notification. I ran to my computer and found the class space open. Without this notification there is no doubt this availability would have been snatched up before I noticed. For this reason, I think the time and money I invested in this program was well worth it.
